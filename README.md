# Clawmania
Clawmania is a game based on the classic Claw Machine game. In this game we have three different types of prizes you can grab, each color correlating to a different kind of prize. The green balls represent time prizes, the blue balls represent speed prizes and the purple balls represent points. All purple balls will give you a point increase at varrying levels, but the blue and green balls have a 50/50 chance of being a negative prize (losing time or moving slower) or a positive prize (adding time or moving faster). You have one minute to get as many points as possible, so choose wisely!
